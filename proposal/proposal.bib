This methodology has generated a myriad of robust associations for a range of traits and diseases, and the number of associated variants is expected to grow steadily as GWAS sample sizes increase. GWAS results have a range of applications, such as gaining insight into a phenotype's underlying biology, estimating its heritability, calculating genetic correlations, making clinical risk predictions, informing drug development programmes and inferring potential causal relationships between risk factors and health outcomes. In this Primer, we provide the reader with an introduction to GWAS, explaining their statistical basis and how they are conducted, describe state-of-the art approaches and discuss limitations and challenges, concluding with an overview of the current and future applications for GWAS results.},

abstract = {Summary
Genome-wide association studies have successfully discovered thousands of common variants associated with human diseases and traits, but the landscape of rare variations in human disease has not been explored at scale. Exome-sequencing studies of population biobanks provide an opportunity to systematically evaluate the impact of rare coding variations across a wide range of phenotypes to discover genes and allelic series relevant to human health and disease. Here, we present results from systematic association analyses of 4,529 phenotypes using single-variant and gene tests of 394,841 individuals in the UK Biobank with exome-sequence data. We find that the discovery of genetic associations is tightly linked to frequency and is correlated with metrics of deleteriousness and natural selection. We highlight biological findings elucidated by these data and release the dataset as a public resource alongside the Genebass browser for rapidly exploring rare-variant association results.}

               data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit
               the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address
               these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool
               set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of
               thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can
               be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well
               as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps
               computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel
               approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of
               whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five
               main domains of function: data management, summary statistics,
               population stratification, association analysis, and
               identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the

               information in the context of population-based whole-genome

  abstract  = "High-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive
               amounts of genetic variation data for diverse genomes, but it
               remains a challenge to pinpoint a small subset of functionally
               important variants. To fill these unmet needs, we developed the
               ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and
               insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional
               consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting
               functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved
               regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes
               Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases from
               the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set conforming to
               Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate a
               'variants reduction' protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels
               from a human genome, including two causal mutations for Miller
               syndrome, a rare recessive disease. Through a stepwise
               procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal,
               and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene.
               Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires ∼4 min to perform
               gene-based annotation and ∼15 min to perform variants reduction
               on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds

  abstract  = "Genome-wide association studies have shown unequivocally that
               common complex disorders have a polygenic genetic architecture
               and have enabled researchers to identify genetic variants
               associated with diseases. These variants can be combined into a
               polygenic risk score that captures part of an individual's
               susceptibility to diseases. Polygenic risk scores have been
               widely applied in research studies, confirming the association
               between the scores and disease status, but their clinical
               utility has yet to be established. Polygenic risk scores may be
               used to estimate an individual's lifetime genetic risk of
               disease, but the current discriminative ability is low in the
               general population. Clinical implementation of polygenic risk
               score (PRS) may be useful in cohorts where there is a higher
               prior probability of disease, for example, in early stages of
               diseases to assist in diagnosis or to inform treatment choices.
               Important considerations are the weaker evidence base in
               application to non-European ancestry and the challenges in
               translating an individual's PRS from a percentile of a normal
               distribution to a lifetime disease risk. In this review, we
               consider how PRS may be informative at different points in the
               disease trajectory giving examples of progress in the field and
               discussing obstacles that need to be addressed before clinical
               implementation.",

abstract={Metabolic traits are heritable phenotypes widely-used in assessing the risk of various diseases. We conduct a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of nine metabolic traits (including glycemic, lipid, liver enzyme levels) in 125,872 Korean subjects genotyped with the Korea Biobank Array. Following meta-analysis with GWAS from Biobank Japan identify 144 novel signals (MAF{\thinspace}≥{\thinspace}1{\%}), of which 57.0{\%} are replicated in UK Biobank. Additionally, we discover 66 rare (MAF{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}1{\%}) variants, 94.4{\%} of them co-incident to common loci, adding to allelic series. Although rare variants have limited contribution to overall trait variance, these lead, in carriers, substantial loss of predictive accuracy from polygenic predictions of disease risk from common variant alone. We capture groups with up to 16-fold variation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence by integration of genetic risk scores of fasting plasma glucose and T2D and the I349F rare protective variant. This study highlights the need to consider the joint contribution of both common and rare variants on inherited risk of metabolic traits and related diseases.},

abstract={The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) programme seeks to elucidate the genetic architecture and biology of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders, with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases. The initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here we describe the TOPMed goals and design as well as the available resources and early insights obtained from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that are available through dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes)1. In the first 53,831 TOPMed samples, we detected more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97{\%} have frequencies of less than 1{\%} and 46{\%} are singletons that are present in only one individual (53{\%} among unrelated individuals). These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The extensive catalogue of genetic variation in TOPMed studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining TOPMed haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately 0.01{\%}.},

               interventions such as structure-based drug development or
               targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17\% of the total
               residues in human protein sequences are covered by an
               experimentally determined structure1. Here we markedly expand
               the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the
               state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold2, at a scale
               that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human
               proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a
               confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues)
               have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics

               interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain
               predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered.
               Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how
               high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological
               hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to
               the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and

               primarily via regulatory mechanisms on the transcriptome. To
               investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis-
               and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses
               using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through
               the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88\% of genes,
               and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL
               (detected for 37\% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested)
               showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication
               power and confounding by cell type composition. However,
               replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized
               intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via
               several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by
               transcription factors. Expression of 13\% of the genes
               correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes,
               pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this
               work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as
               a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex
               phenotypes.",

abstract={Inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) family members are key regulatory proteins in a wide range of developmental and cellular processes and function by inhibiting target proteins that include the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, members of the Ets protein family and retinoblastoma.Ids serve as downstream targets of known oncogenic pathways. However, the characterization of Id expression in human tumours and mouse models of cancer requires more careful analysis.Ids can contribute to tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell differentiation, stimulating proliferation and facilitating tumour neoangiogenesis.Id overexpression might mimic the activity of other oncogenes or the loss of tumour suppressor activity.The low postnatal expression of the Ids and their roles in tumorigenesis and tumour neoangiogenesis mark them as attractive targets for anti-cancer therapy.},

               identifying CRISPR-Cas single guide RNA (sgRNA) targets. In this
               major update of CHOPCHOP, we expand our toolbox beyond
               knockouts. We introduce functionality for targeting RNA with
               Cas13, which includes support for alternative transcript
               isoforms and RNA accessibility predictions. We incorporate new
               DNA targeting modes, including CRISPR activation/repression,
               targeted enrichment of loci for long-read sequencing, and
               prediction of Cas9 repair outcomes. Finally, we expand our
               results page visualization to reveal alternative isoforms and
               downstream ATG sites, which will aid users in avoiding the
               expression of truncated proteins. The CHOPCHOP web tool now
               supports over 200 genomes and we have released a command-line
               script for running larger jobs and handling unsupported genomes.
