Hi Professor X,

My name is Chinmay and I'm a Bioinformatics Phd Student currently working on completing their prelims.

My project will be about *Studying the Effects of Rare Variants in Metabolic Syndrome*, and I have included the 1 page Aims page approved by the Prelims Aims Review Committee.

Due to your expertise in XXX I felt that you would provide good insight into the problem, and I would like you to join my prelims committee.

I plan to give my prelim exam sometime in April.

Let me know if you would be available to participate and would like to join.

Thanks,
Chinmay
